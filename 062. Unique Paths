A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


class Solution:
    # @return an integer
    def fac(self,n):
        fac=1
        for i in xrange(1,n+1):
            fac*=i
        return fac
        
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        return self.fac(m+n-2)/self.fac(n-1)/self.fac(m-1)
